wsio -- web stream input/output tool

Usage: wsio [options] [user[:pass]@][hostname][path]
  -l  Listen to stream and print to STDOUT
  -s  Use HTTPS
  -k  Ignore SSL verification (like curl)
  
By default, wsio listens to STDIN and does an HTTP POST for each line.

This tool is similar to netcat in that it's intended to be used with STDIN and
STDOUT, making it perfect for command pipelining. However, instead of direct
point to point TCP/UDP connections, it uses HTTP. Coupled with a server that
provides realtime pubsub over HTTP and you have one of the most magical tools
ever. Example:

Log Aggregation
===============

Run this on one or several machines:

  tail -f /var/log/something | wsio somehost/log

Run this on your central aggregator:

  wsio -l somehost/log > /var/log/aggregate

Run this on your *laptop* behind a NAT to watch the logs:

  wsio -l somehost/log
